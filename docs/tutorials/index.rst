Tutorial
========

We use the AlexNet model and BOLD5000 dataset [#0]_ to demonstrate the versatility and usability of DNNBrain in characterizing the DNN and in
examining the correspondences between the DNN and the brain. The results are also used in our `bioRxiv paper <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.05.188847v1>`__, and more description about the model and dataset can be found at the 'Methods' part of this paper.

.. topic:: Data:

   | The stimulus images are available by click `here <https://osf.io/hy5m7/download>`__, and a :doc:`.stim.csv <../user_guide/file_format>` file named as `all_5000scenes.stim.csv <https://osf.io/7c8th/download>`__ is used to tell DNNBrain where and what the inputs are.
   | The BOLD response maps for each image are available at `here <https://osf.io/ube86/download>`__.

.. topic:: Tutorials:

   - In :doc:`Scan DNN <scan_DNN>` tutorial, we extract and display feature maps of three images for each convolutional layer after ReLU.
   
   - In :doc:`Probe DNN <probe_DNN>` tutorial, we reveal animate information presented in DNN layers.
   
   - In :doc:`Map between DNN and brain <map_between_DNN_and_brain>` tutorial, we examine how well the representation from each layer predict the response of a voxel in the brain by using voxel-wise encoding models. In addition, we also use representational similarity analysis to characterize the link between the representations of DNN and brain.
   
   - In :doc:`Visualize DNN <visualize_DNN>` tutorial, We use three visualization ways to examine the stimulus features that an artificial neuron prefers.
